soon-soon
- test, a lot
- profile, optimise

Soon-ish:
- add general recursors' reduction in the reduction engine
- switch to locally nameless representation in the kernel
- finally finish CCobs somewhere ?

Long run :
- pattern-matching + exhaustiveness-check + termination-check
- elaboration 
- general inductive types framework
