soon-soon
- parse universes
- enable universe substitution
- enable back proof-irrelevance
- make the right monad for command elaboration
- add syntax for commands
- test, a lot


Soon-ish:
- implement some axioms like True/False, Nat and Eq
- add recursors' reduction in the reduction engine
- finally finish CCobs somewhere ?


Long run :
- pattern-matching + exhaustiveness-check + termination-check
- elaboration 
- general inductive types framework
