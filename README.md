# Proost

An reimplementation of the Proost proof-assistant written in Lean 4

The goal of this project is mainly to both get more familiar with writing functional code in Lean, as well as allowing me to experiment on features that could then be implemented in Proost.

In it's objective of being as efficient as possible, Proost's implementation has become quite tedious to work with. Implementing things here first allows me to experiment at a faster pace than on the Rust repo.
